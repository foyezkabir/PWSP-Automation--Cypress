// Step 1: Import Locators
    // Import the locators for the Update Customer form elements like name, phone, email, DOB, address, status toggle, and the submit button.

// Step 2: Define Customer Management Class
    // Define a class that encapsulates customer management functionality. This class will contain methods related to customer operations, including updating an existing customer.

// Step 3: Implement UpdateCustomer Method
    // Within the class, implement the UpdateCustomer method which includes the following steps:
        //   a. Locate and Select Edit Icon - Find the edit icon in the customer management section and click on it to open the customer update interface.
        //   b. Update Customer Name - Clear the existing name and input the new name in the name field.
        //   c. Update Customer Phone - Clear the existing phone number and input the new phone number.
        //   d. Update Customer Email - Clear the existing email and input the new email.
        //   e. Update Customer DOB - Clear the existing DOB and input the new DOB.
        //   f. Update Customer Address - Clear the existing address and input the new address.
        //   g. Optional Status Toggle - Check and toggle a switch or option if it's part of the form to set the desired status.
        //   h. Submit the Updated Information - Click the submit button to save the changes made to the customer.

// Step 4: Wait for Customer Update to Process
    // After submitting, wait for the system to process the update. This may involve a brief waiting period to ensure the customer information is updated successfully.

// Step 5: Export the Customer Management Class Instance
    // Export an instance of the customer management class. This allows other parts of the application or test suite to use the class for customer-related operations.

// Step 6: Usage in Test Cases
    // In test files, import the exported class instance and use its methods to perform actions like updating a customer as part of various test scenarios.
