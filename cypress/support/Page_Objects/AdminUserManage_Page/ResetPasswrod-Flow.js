   ---------- RESET PASSWORD CONFIRM & CANCEL PROCESS FLOW ---------- 

// Step 1: Import Locators
    // Import the locators for the User Management form elements like full name, username, email, phone, user role, status toggle, and submit button.

// Step 2: Define User Management Class
    // Define a class that encapsulates user management functionality. This class will contain methods related to user operations, including adding, updating, and resetting passwords for users.

// Step 3: Implement ResetUserPasswordConfirm and ResetUserPasswordCancel Methods
    // These methods handle resetting a user's password with confirmation or cancellation:
        //   a. Open Reset Password Interface - Click the 'Reset Password' button.
        //   b. Confirm or Cancel Reset :
                - For ResetUserPasswordConfirm, click the confirm option. 
                - For ResetUserPasswordCancel, click the cancel option.

// Step 4: Export the User Management Class Instance
    // Export an instance of the user management class. This makes the class accessible to other files where user management functionality is required.

// Step 5: Usage in Test Cases
    // In test files, import the exported class instance and use its methods to perform actions like adding, updating, or resetting user passwords as part of various test scenarios.
