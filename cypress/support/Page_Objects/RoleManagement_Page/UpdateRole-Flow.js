// Step 1: Import Locators
    // Import the locators for the role editing elements such as the edit icon, role name input, status toggle, and submit button.

// Step 2: Define Role Management Class
    // Define a class that encapsulates role management functionality. This class will contain methods related to role operations, including editing an existing role.

// Step 3: Implement EditRole Method
    // Within the class, implement the EditRole method which includes the following steps:
        //   a. Locate and Select Edit Icon - Find the edit icon in the role management section and click on it to open the edit interface.
        //   b. Update Role Name - In the edit interface, clear the existing role name and type in the new role name.
        //   c. Check and Toggle Status Switch (Optional) - If there is a status switch, check its current state and toggle if necessary to change its state.
        //   d. Submit the Updated Information - Click the submit button to save the changes made to the role.

// Step 4: Export the Role Management Class Instance
// Export an instance of the role management class. This makes the class accessible to other files where role management functionality is required.

// Step 5: Usage in Test Cases
// In test files, import the exported class instance and use its methods to perform actions like editing a role as part of various test scenarios.
