// Step 1: Import Locators
    // Import the locators for the User Management form elements like full name, username, email, phone, user role, status toggle, and submit button.

// Step 2: Define User Management Class
    // Define a class that encapsulates user management functionality. This class will contain methods related to user operations, including adding, updating, and resetting passwords for users.

// Step 3: Implement UpdateUser Method
    // Implement the UpdateUser method with steps:
        //   a. Locate and Select Edit Icon - Find the edit icon for the specific user and click to open the edit interface.
        //   b. Update User Details - Update the user's full name, email, and phone number.
        //   c. Change User Role - Select a new role for the user if necessary.
        //   d. Toggle Status - Click to change the user's status if required.

// Step 4: Export the User Management Class Instance
    // Export an instance of the user management class. This makes the class accessible to other files where user management functionality is required.

// Step 5: Usage in Test Cases
    // In test files, import the exported class instance and use its methods to perform actions like adding, updating, or resetting user passwords as part of various test scenarios.
