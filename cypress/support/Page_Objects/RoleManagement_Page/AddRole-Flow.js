// Step 1: Import Locators
    // Import the locators for the Add Role form elements like name, description, status toggle, and the submit button.

// Step 2: Define Role Management Class
    // Define a class that encapsulates role management functionality. This class will contain methods related to role operations, including adding a new role.

// Step 3: Implement AddRole Method
    // Within the class, implement the AddRole method which includes the following steps:
        //   a. Open Add Role Form - Initiate the action to open the role addition form or modal by clicking the add button.
        //   b. Enter Role Name - Input the role's name into the name field.
        //   c. Enter Role Description - Input the role's description into the description field.
        //   d. Optional Status Toggle - If there is a status toggle switch, check its current state and click if necessary to set the desired status.
        //   e. Submit the Form - Click the submit button to finalize adding the role.

// Step 4: Wait for Role Addition to Process
    // After submitting, wait for the system to process the addition of the new role. This may involve a brief waiting period to ensure the role is added successfully.

// Step 5: Export the Role Management Class Instance
    // Export an instance of the role management class. This makes the class accessible to other files where role management functionality is required.

// Step 6: Usage in Test Cases
    // In test files, import the exported class instance and use its methods to perform actions like adding a role as part of various test scenarios.
