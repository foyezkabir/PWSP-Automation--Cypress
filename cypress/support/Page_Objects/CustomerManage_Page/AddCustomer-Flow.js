// Step 1: Import Locators
    // Import the locators for the Add Customer form elements like name, phone, email, DOB, address, and the submit button.

// Step 2: Define Customer Management Class
    // Define a class that encapsulates customer management functionality. This class will contain methods related to customer operations, including adding a new customer.

// Step 3: Implement AddCustomer Method
    // Within the class, implement the AddCustomer method which includes the following steps:
        //   a. Open Add Customer Form - Initiate the action to open the customer addition form or modal.
        //   b. Enter Customer Name - Input the customer's name into the name field.
        //   c. Enter Customer Phone - Input the customer's phone number into the phone field.
        //   d. Enter Customer Email - Input the customer's email into the email field.
        //   e. Set Customer DOB - Input the customer's date of birth into the DOB field.

        //   h. Submit the Form - Click the submit button to finalize adding the customer.

// Step 4: Export the Customer Management Class Instance

// Step 5: Usage in Test Cases
    // In test files, import the exported class instance and utilize its methods to perform actions like adding a customer as part of various test scenarios.
